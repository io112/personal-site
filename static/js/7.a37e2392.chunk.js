I have different experiences in building IT systems. Most of my production experience is in golang fintech. With small team of developers, we have built highly loaded platform for issuing loans as part of large [Ozon](https://ozon.ru/) Fintech platform. I have worked with Golang, grpc, kafka, Kubernetes, client balancing in loans core system.\n\n\n# Some history\n\n# Developing of high loaded microservices on Golang\n\nI was engaged in the development of the core of a highly loaded loan issuance system, as one of the products for business as part of OZON Fintech. Ozon Fintech is the financial direction of Ozon (one of the biggest e-commerce in Russia), it includes Ozon Bank, Ozon premium and business products. As one of the products for business, crediting of sellers of the platform is being developed. My tasks included developing new microservices and maintaining/supplementing existing ones on Go and developing backoffice on Python (Django). Stack Golang, grpc, openapi, Kubernetes, python, Django, http, PostgreSQL.\n\n# Web application support and development\n\nSince 2019, I have been supporting the IT infrastructure of a small production as a system administrator and developing a web application for sales automation. Since the standard 1C (accounting system) solution did not suit the customer, I developed an alternative system for assembling the goods and printing out the relevant documents with full integration with 1C. I have been involved in this development from architecture design to implementation into production. Technology stack: Python, Flask, Docker, CI/CD, MongoDB, JQuery.\n\n# Project ALICE\n\nALICE is a CERN project, which stands for the large hadron collider. For half a year, I led a Moscow student group developing one of the collider subsystems for a future launch. Together with colleagues and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, we developed a system for collecting collider metadata. (Bookkeeping) Development was carried out on the WebUI framework (CERN internal development) and NodeJS.\n",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(o.jsx)(a.b,Object(i.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(o.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Dmitry Paramonov",children:Object(o.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(o.jsx)("header",{children:Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(o.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(o.jsx)(a.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(o.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(o.jsx)(r.a,{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
